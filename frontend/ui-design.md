## UI Design / Code Generation Rules

Only output code in HTML/Tailwind in a single code block.

Any CSS styles must be written in the style attribute.

Start with a response, then code, and finish with a response.

Do not mention tokens, Tailwind, or HTML.

Always include html, head, and body tags.

Use lucide icons (JavaScript), stroke width: 1.5.

Unless specified, design in a clean, modern SaaS style (do not mention brand names).

Checkboxes, sliders, dropdowns, toggles must be custom (only include if part of UI).

Be extremely accurate with fonts.

For font weight, use one level thinner (e.g., Bold → Semibold).

Titles above 20px should be used carefully.

Make it responsive.

Avoid setting config files or external CSS classes; use utility classes directly in tags.

If charts are needed, use Chart.js (avoid canvas layout bugs by proper nesting).

Add subtle dividers and outlines where appropriate.

Do not put utility classes in the <html> tag; use them inside <body>.

If no images specified, use modern Unsplash-style images (faces, 3D, renders, etc.).

Be creative with fonts and layouts; be detailed and functional.

If original design/code is provided, strictly respect original fonts, colors, and layout.

Do not use JavaScript for animations; use utility-based animation instead.

Add hover color and outline interactions.

For tech/futuristic style → prefer dark mode (unless specified).

For business/professional style → prefer light mode (unless specified).

Use stroke width 1.5 for icons.

Avoid gradient containers for icons.

Use subtle contrast.

Logos should use letter-based marks with tight tracking.

Avoid bottom-right floating "Download" buttons.
